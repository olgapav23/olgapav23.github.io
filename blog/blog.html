				Motion Design. These two words don't make much sense to me when put together without an additional word between them – graphic. Motion Graphic Design, that something I can work with. Let's break this down:
				<em>Motion</em> – an act of moving something or someone by himself or herself or with some additional help. When we walk we create motion. When we stand we barely create any motion. Even when we sleep we still create some motion very minimal but nevertheless some. So we create motion pretty much all the time. 
				<em>Graphic</em> – an adjective that relates to visual art, drawing, lettering or digital art. This word helps to describe something that is visual, something that has been created to represent some idea in an illustrative form. 
				<em>Design</em> – an often-overused word in today’s world. Designing today means creating, if you created something you might consider yourself a designer. I believe in a different definition of this word. Design for me is about planning rather than creating, it’s about a thought and idea that appeared before the final creation. Being a designer doesn’t mean to be a creator(that’s more of artist definition), it means you are the though developer, problem solver and function builder.
				So let’s combine all those words and what do we have: a visual plan or thought that potentially can move by itself or with someone’s help. 
				Wikipedia defines MGD as
				</p>
				<ul>
				"a subset of graphic design in that it uses graphic design principles in a filmmaking or video production context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of animation or filmic techniques."
				</ul>
				<p>
				I mean I wasn't completely wrong with my minimalistic definition. This I would say a more specific, more technical definition of what MGD is. However, I think to actually understand what Motion Design is you need to understand what those words mean for you.  For some this relates to performance art, for some to video and animation work, or maybe on-screen/web design. I defined it for myself, but people define it for themselves.<br> So what does it mean for you?

				<p>Starting to think of motion design in terms of interaction. As I did it in a previous post, I think it’s important to have clear definition of these big words we are using on the daily basis(or maybe not a daily but still quite often). 
				So what is interaction. Let’s start from formal definition:<br>
				Merriam-Webster defines interaction as a mutual or reciprocal action or influence.
				Okay, what does that mean? Well, the way I see it, interaction is about nonverbal communication. I mean it can be verbal, but I think in terms of motion design it must be thought of as nonverbal communication. …”reciprocal action” - a movement that has some respons. So interaction is about action between two objects(two people, an object and a person, two objects), where each one has some kind of response to each other’s movement. 
				I think interaction is directly connected to motion design. Especially when it comes to app and web design. There’s body movement that often triggers any designed motion on the screen. Most of motion design that appears on the screen is pre-determined, however there are some that are free-flow and determined by the user. And those of course leve the biggest impact on the user. Then there’s an interaction of certain elements on the screen. That’s what’s called behind the scene interaction. An interaction that is usually not seen with bare eyes. Pretty much all different types are connected to one another and happen coherently, and that’s what makes interaction in terms of motion design most exciting.
