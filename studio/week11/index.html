				Black and white typography is a classic medium, but the lasting impact Herb Lubalin's distinctive typography had on design sets his work apart.

				Lubalin designed many logos and print ads alongside his magazines. Though Lubalin rarely drew his lettering himself, he collaborated with others for his predominantly type-centric work.

				As his 1959 ad for Sudler & Hennessy declares, Lubalin lets his typography talk; it is known for its expressiveness and illustrative nature, and it remains ground-breaking and unique.<br>
