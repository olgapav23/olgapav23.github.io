		<h1>Week 1</h1>
		<h2>Research Word - Motion</h2>
		<p> What does this mean in interactive design?<br>
			How can this word be interpreted through interactive technologies?</p>

		<p><strong>1. Making connections:</strong><br>
			<em>Motion > Dynamic > Active</em>
			<ul>
				<li>Sensing technologies</li>
				<li>experience the movement</li>
				<li><b>Kinaethetics</b> - the left sense of the movement</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Movement of a user in the process of interaction with technology is a must to trigger an action from the technology.<br>
			There are however different type of movement that user can do to trigger that interaction:
			<ul>
				<li>Eye movement - mimic</li>
				<li>Hand Movement - gestures</li>
				<li>Body Movement - full/part-body interaction</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			There are also different types of input technology can allow the interaction:
			<ul>
				<li>Tactile - multi-touch, direct body to screen interaction</li>
				<li>Supported - through additional technology(mouse, trackpad, pen&touch tablets)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Tactile learning</em> is a learning style in whihch learning by the students carrying out physical activities rather than listening to a lecture or watching demonstration.

		</p>
		<p> <strong> This concept of Kinestetic Interaction consists of three axioms: </strong></p>
			<ol>
			<li>Psychology - memory connections and our expreiences trigger sensory feedback</li>
			<li>Interactive Technology - movement caught through sensors(light, sound and temperature), electtomagnetic field and ultrasonic sounds</li>
			<li>kinethetic experience - it grounds our everyday actions in the world </li>
			</ol>
		<p>
			<em>Questions to consider for furthere research</em>
			<ol>
				<li>What affects people's decisions?</li>
				<li>How and when websites decided whether things like dropdown menus and in-text links would be easy for users to catch and understand how to use?</li>
				<li>How far can a designer step away from what's considered conventional and create somethign new whether visually or structurally?</li>
			</ol>
