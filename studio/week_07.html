				Motion Design. These two words don't make much sense to me when put together without an additional word between them – graphic. Motion Graphic Design, that something I can work with. Let's break this down:
				<em>Motion</em> – an act of moving something or someone by himself or herself or with some additional help. When we walk we create motion. When we stand we barely create any motion. Even when we sleep we still create some motion very minimal but nevertheless some. So we create motion pretty much all the time. 
				<em>Graphic</em> – an adjective that relates to visual art, drawing, lettering or digital art. This word helps to describe something that is visual, something that has been created to represent some idea in an illustrative form. 
				<em>Design</em> – an often-overused word in today’s world. Designing today means creating, if you created something you might consider yourself a designer. I believe in a different definition of this word. Design for me is about planning rather than creating, it's about a though and idea that appeared before the final creation. Being a designer doesn’t mean to be a creator(that's more of artist definition), it means you are the though developer, problem solver and function builder.
				So let's combine all those words and what do we have: a visual plan or though that potentially can move by itself or with someones help. 
				Wikipedia defines MGD as
				</p>
				<ul>
				"a subset of graphic design in that it uses graphic design principles in a filmmaking or video production context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of animation or filmic techniques."
				</ul>
				<p>
				I mean I wasn't completely wrong with my minimalistic definition. This I would say a more specific, more technical definition of what MGD is. However, I think to actually understand what Motion Design is you need to understand what those words mean for you.  For some this relates to performance art, for some to video and animation work, or maybe on-screen/wed design. I defined it for myself, but people define it for themselves.<br> So what does it mean for you?
