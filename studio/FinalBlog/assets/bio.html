					<p id="bio">
					Olga Pavlova is an interdisciplinary graphic designer, with main interest in poster design and motion graphics. Focusing on typography and creative visual representation, she designs posters for theater productions, small businesses, educational institutions, and individuals. She is also highly inspired by endless motion graphics creations from around the world, particularly title sequence design. Olga would love to work and learn with todayâ€™s best motion designers and hopes to be able to create even more visually stunning title sequences than the ones motion designers create today.<br>
					<br>Born and raised in a small town in the middle of Kazakhstan, Olga decided to learn the craft of graphic design by immersing herself in different environments. Since she came to the U.S. three years ago, she has lived in rural and urban environments from New England to the Rockies, all while adapting to a new culture. Today, Olga lives in New York City and is studying communication design at the Parsons School of Design.
