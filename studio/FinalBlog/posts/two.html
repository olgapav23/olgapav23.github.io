				Advertising and Propaganda try to communicate with an audience and to fully understand the methods used to succeed in this process, and compare their effectiveness one should understand communication theory. <br><br>
				Communication theory is a field of mathematics and information theory, which on its own looks into the quantification and storage; it studies the technical process of information and the process of human communication. So in simpler words it’s about the information itself, how humans process it and how information affects people.<br><br>
				Communication itself known to us is the process of sending and receiving messages(aka information) or transferring information from one part to another.
				There are basic elements that build up the communication process and communication theory as well: <br><br>
				First one is the Source, this element, as information theorist Claude Elwood Shannon explains it, “produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal.” <br>
				Second one is the Sender: Shannon calls this element the “transmitter”, which “operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel.” <br>
				Then there is a Channel, which is the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver.” <br>
				Next one is the Receiver, who obtains the information from the sender, reconstructing the message.” <br>
				Destination, is what Shannon describes as “the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended”. <br>
				Message: is a concept, information, or statement that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient. <br>
				Lastly there is Feedback. That comes from a receiver to original sender.
				<br><br>
				All of these elements are taken in consideration and carefully examined before executing an appropriate message for advertising. Particular attention is given to a source and destination elements; these help to determine what will be an appropriate visual and text. After text has been decided on, images are selected to support it and further build the message. Then comes the choice of a channel, and in case of this research it was posters. Taking in consideration all of the above, helps to understand how communication theory is applied to advertising and propaganda and study the influence both have on people. It must be noticed, that biggest discoveries in the communication theory field were actually made by researchers during WWI and WWII period, who focused on propaganda. They were asking a question of: how can communication be utilized to create behavioral changes? <br><br>
				During wartime Governments desired to function efficiently, and believed that the way to achieve that was by cooperating directly with their citizens. They seem to achieve that through the use of propaganda and in present time it’s more often known as social advertising.
