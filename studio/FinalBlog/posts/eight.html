				All of these themes that I’ve researched and design elements identified led me to a question: Are all contemporary commercial materials are just a new form of propaganda?
				<br><br>
				A short and easy answer is yes. However, there should a deeper understanding of historical development of advertising and of course close examination of many other examples to have a full comparison.
				<br><br>
				Advertising developed as a mean of mass production and helps daily to spread a word about a product, an event, an issue or just to humor people sometimes. There are no rules in advertising when it comes to designing, as long as it contains all copy, and emphasizes the important it’s good to go. It’s usually up to a designer to determine whether this ad will have any visual material accompanying it. 
				Roughly, there are millions of options that an ad can turn out. However, advertisers are concerned with its effectiveness and appeal to the target audience than anything else. That’s why advertisers created certain strategies that they incorporate in their campaigns. This is how designer stopped being in control of visual appearnace of an ad and had to start following “rules” or methologies. And once your realize that incorporation of rules was implemented by someone else we can go back to communication theory and remember how the public opinion was forced by “someone”. Well, in this case it becomes obvious that this someone are advertisers that use similar methodology to government propaganda during war period.
