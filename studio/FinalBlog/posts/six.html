				Throughout my “excursion” through propaganda material I’ve noticed one fascinating thing about them. Propaganda, the word, has a negative connotation, however, not long after wartime it had a trustworthy and respected look, which was used in different way later on. Trusted propaganda look, especially in the U.S, was used to deliver other messages, particularly related to social issues.One of the most common examples that I found was a promotion of protected sex and use of imagery to point out possible consequences of the opposite. These used humor, comparison and exaggerated imagery to emphasize the importance and build a certain opinion around the topic.
				<br><br>
				After that I’ve stumbled upon many more other examples that promoted food-conservation, women’s involvement in industrialization, and “invitations” to work to achieve better results. What fascinated me the most that some of them though ran in the United States carried quite a socialistic message. From after war period, there doesn’t seem to be many examples of posters of such style, but with wide-spread of digital software, designers and artist seem to pick up the propagandistic visual style again and experiment with it even further, altering themes, messages and sometimes even playing with seemingly established color scheme. The combination of all of them would certainly eliminate even an a small trait of propagandistic style, but it seem to carry stylistic elements in some way.
				<br><br>
				The ones that referred to humorous side would include social problems as well but in more humanistic and “lighter” way. Their approach would be to deliver a peaceful message through use of propaganda as a contradiction of the message to what the look carries in itself. For me personally, these posters don’t work as effectively as social advertising because of the contradiction and use of parody the essence of the original message vanishes and doesn’t seem as important anymore.
