				The most notable remarks regarding propaganda through the lense of communication theory were made by Walter Lippmann. He was a writer, reporter, and political commentator among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War, coined the term “stereotype” in the modern psychological meaning, and critiqued media and democracy in his newspaper column and several books, particularly known his 1922 book Public Opinion. In that book Lippman says “what is propaganda, if not the effort to alter the picture to which men respond, to substitute one social pattern for another.”<br>
				<br>
				He widely criticized influence of media over people’s minds and how people must look for truth on their own to eventually form the public opinion. He says, “Public opinions should be organized for the press if they are to be sound, not by the press as it is the case today.”<br>
				<br>
				These statements can be clearly observed in many propaganda posters and advertising as well. The implications of forcing the public opinion could be different, but strategies used to promote those messages are very similar. When it comes to designing advertising and propaganda posters there are certain design elements that they have in common. Those used to enhance that public opinion created by … somebody, whether press, governments or commercial companies.
