				There are about 12 common types of advertising, however, for the purpose of comparison in this presentation I will only talk about four that are similar to the propaganda types introduced in the earlier post. To remind from a previous post four identified types of propaganda are: patriotic, sentimental, humorous, and “showing the enemy”.
				<br><br>
				In advertising a similar type would use celebrities or people that general audience looks up to, to promote a product or tell a story, sell an idea. In product promotion especially one thing that advertisers aim to achieve is to “get credit” for their brand. The use of a recurring character, or celebrity, can help cement a brand’s identity into the viewer’s brain.
				<br>
				The closest example in advertising is “exemplar story”. These ads weave a narrative that helps illustrate the product’s benefits. The key is to create “a situation where you’d use [the product] and be very glad for it.” It’s more common to see this advertising as a :30 second short TV or online commercial, but there are examples in posters.
				<br>
				Advertising has more examples like that but also tends to go overboard with it. More commonly it’s seen as “parody or borrowed format.” This is a popular approach these days, probably because pop-culture references have become our common language. Mocking an issue also is very common in advertising, it helps to bring humor and lighten up the topic. There are also instances of incorporating humor in social issue advertising. United Colors of Benetton ads have that in common, but this example I think is the best example of it. Imagery presented is funny yet in combination with a title makes you think of the problem.
				<br>
				This another topic that is used in advertising very commonly. Besides just exaggerated object it is usually shown together with something else creating a “comparison”. These ads include a lot of previous elements as well (like humor and exemplar story), but are particularly impactful because of visible exaggeration.
