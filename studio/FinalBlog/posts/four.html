				There are four main types of propaganda that were identified by an educator Darlene Mahaney in her article. She clarifies that these were mostly found during WWII period in the United States, however similar examples can be found throughout Europe and even socialistic parts of Asia.
				<br><br>
				First one and most common kind was the patriotic, which would illustrate strong characters using predominantly red, blue and white colors to capture positive attitude and promote the right cause. This type would also use familiar to everyone imagery like Uncle Sam or statue of Liberty something everyone recognizes and trusts in. Examples of these posters also very easy to find among Russian and Chinese propaganda.
				<br><br>
				Second type would capture the sentiment of the moment, whether “a young woman reading the V-mail from her loved one”, or a family waiting for a returning soldier. This type could also capture the moment of “looking into the future”, with hopeful message and potential bright future. These very to be used to evoke stronger emotions, and helped to affect even those that weren’t involved in war directly, but be supportive of those around them and families whose sons and husbands were at the war front.
				<br><br>
				Mocking an enemy and incorporating humor was another technique used in propaganda posters. This way it brings light on the issue and makes people smile in such hard situations.
				<br><br>
				Lastly, there were posters that showed the negative side of war, with warnings about consequences of possible defeat. Exaggerations of the way the enemy looked were the most common. They helped to put an image in people’s heads and make sure that the message along with it terrifies therefore helps to ensure that everyone has same opinion on the enemy. “Liberators” is German poster that is a combination of everything that America represents and how germany wants its people view their enemy.
