				World War implies the effects on nations globally, therefore it’s logical to take a look at propaganda globally. There are many unexpected things that I came up in my research, the way countries represent their enemies, messages sent to their communities, as well as noticeable presence of national art period characteristics, including drawing, typefaces and format. 
				<br><br>
				Chinese propaganda carried a lot of socialistic style references, including colors(red, white, yellow, blue and black), bold type, imagery of powerful leaders or strong community characters.
				<br><br>
				British propaganda was very specialized and most of the time showed soldiers and scenes from war along with the message. However, sometimes you could observe something like the example I present on the left. It’s a combination of exaggeration imagery together with negative and humorist connotations. 
				<br><br>
				French propaganda, surprisingly, was caring a lot of socialistic notions in itself. In many examples that I observed the flag was almost always present along with scenes of defeat of enemy or talks about social issues such as hunger and living conditions. The example I present here has wheat along with very communistic sign - sickle.
				<br><br> 
				Lastly, Russian propaganda has very forceful nature, that includes typical socialistic propaganda style: bright colors, bold typography, “powerful” imagery. Many of Russian propaganda has themes of praising the good leaders and empowering people with images of same common folk in the field, or presenting the horrible enemy — capitalism.
