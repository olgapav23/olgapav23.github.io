			<h3>Interaction of Color: Explanation</h3>
			<p>For this exercise I picked triad of colors: green, purple and orange. I started by creating three rectangles with three solid colors. I then created extra three extra rectangles with lowered opacity to bring in other various tints of same colors. Each of rectangles intersect in some way in order to create various values and hues of these colors. Lastly I changes the size of solid purple rectangle to be able to see its interplay of all the colors present on the page.</p>
