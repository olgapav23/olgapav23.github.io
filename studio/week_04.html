				<h2> Research Word - Motion</h2>
					<p>Some of this information is from the google alerts that I set and some that I found by simple Google search.<br>
					I looked into more information on importance of motion/movement in interaction design.
					The first thing I found this week was the video originally posted on lynda.com and part of longer series about interaction design, but basically talks about ways people respond to motion,- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29KdgmPfSNc">Interaction design: How people respond to motion</a>. Some of the important points mentioned in this video:
						<ul>
							<li>Motion attracts attention, therefore can be used to direct it</li>
							<li>We can direct audiences attention to hide and show information(dropdown menus, ads, pop-ups, fading in and out)</li>
							<li>Also associations can be created through motion. Helps to identify relationships or connections</li>
							<li>Can also lead to distraction</li>
							<li>Such motion as refreshing our browser can cause distraction and lead to losing focus and not uderstanding the differences that occured after refreshing</li>
							<li>Video is a pimary source of motion in interactive design today</li>
							<li>To enhance user experience some cosiderations must be dealt with when using video in your design:</li>
								<ol>
									<li>Avoid auto-play</li>
									<li>Provide media and audio control</li>
									<li>Provide progress and status information</li>
								</ol>
						</ul>
					<p>Another thing that I stumbled upon is the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/antoniodepasquale/design-in-motion-the-new-frontier-of-interaction-design">"Design in motion. The new frontier of interaction design" by Antonio De Pasquale</a> where he discusses the common qualities and similar parts between Interaction and Motion.<br>
					Important points from the presentation:
					<ul>
						<li>Interaction >> Communication >> Motion</li>
					</ul>
