			<p><strong>Barynya</strong> is a fast Russian folk dance and music. The word barynya (Russian landlady) was used by simple folk as a form of addressing to a woman of higher class, a feminine form for the word "barin", landlord.<br>
			A number of Russian folkloric dance ensembles bear the name.
			The Barynya dance is an alternation of chastushkas and frenetic dancing.
			The Barynya chastuskas used to have the refrain, kind of "Barynya, barynya, sudarynya-barynya". The content was often humoristic, even lewd.
			The dancing was without special choreography and consisted mainly of fancy stomping and traditional Russian squatwork â€“ knee bending.
			There are a number of scenic, more refined versions of the dance.
