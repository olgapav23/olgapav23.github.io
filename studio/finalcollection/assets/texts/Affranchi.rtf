\fs24 The Affranchi is a traditional cultural dance that originated in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Domingue"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Saint-Domingue}}, the modern day {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Haiti}}.\
The word {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affranchi"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 Affranchi}}, was used to describe people that were descendants of a European and an African slave in colonial times in Haiti. The dance involved a series of straight-backed, held-torso, French style figures and then African-styled improvisation on the final set\cf4 \cb3 \super  \cf2 \cb3 \nosupersub much like the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumba_francesa"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 tumba francesa}} that later emerged in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 Cuba}} by Haitian refugees escaping the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 Haitian Revolution}}, but was performed to the string and woodwind instruments, instead of the drums.\
Europeans in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Domingue"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Saint-Domingue}} delighted in the affranchi entertainment. Both Europeans and Affranchis performed the varied line and square configurations and often made slaves dance to entertain colonial guests. Affranchi practices spread throughout Haiti and was accompanied by African-descended Kings and Queens. This highly regarded performance style and regal association was also taken to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 Cuba}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 Puerto Rico}}, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 United States}} and to the rest of the disapora in the late eighteenth century.}
