\cf3 \cb4 \strokec3 The 
\b Gombey
\b0  is an iconic symbol of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Bermuda}}, this {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklife"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 folklife}} tradition reflecting the island\'92s blend of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 African}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 indigenous peoples}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Caribbean}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 British}} cultures, incorporating them over time into a unique performance art full of colourful and intricate masquerade, dance and drumming.\
Dancers are usually male, and perform in groups of 10-30 though in modern times female groups have emerged. The traditions have been passed down orally from one generation to the next within families and the Captains of each troupe determine the direction of the troupe and style that is taught. Thus within troupes there can be found subtle but distinct differences in beats, dances, costumes, headdresses, by which they can each be recognised.\

\b \cf2 \strokec2 History
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa140\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \strokec3 Historically, the Gombeys were not viewed as a respectable art form by the island's ruling class and were banned by the slave masters. Slaves were allowed to dance only once a year and did so in masks in order to protest, without fear of retribution, the injustices done them by their slave masters.\
In an article from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Gazette_(Bermuda)"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf5 \strokec5 The Royal Gazette}} newspaper posted on January 10, 1831, a reward is being offered for the return of two slaves by the names of Ajax and Mentor who: "[w]ent off without a cause at Christmas, following that Idolatrous procession the Gumba. It is hoped that this late nuisance, the Gumba and other clamorous puppet shows of the Negroes, will meet the attention of all men of reflection that they be suppressed \'96 as none but the worst or most ignorant Negroes follow such ridiculous shows."\
Henceforth Gombey tradition is at its liveliest during the Christmas season, traditionally performed during {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Boxing Day}}, where the troupes would march the whole day around the island with crowds of followers. Also performances could be seen on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Easter}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 New Year's Day}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Day"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Bermuda Day}} and in modern times at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 soccer}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 cricket}} matches and other festivals and celebrations.\
The word "Gombey" is related to the Bahamian "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goombay"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Goombay}}", a similar musical tradition. It also refers to a specific drum of African origin (see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Caribbean_drums"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 List of Caribbean drums}}). In addition to the Bahamian Goombay tradition, Gombey is similar to some other Afro-Caribbean styles and celebrations (such as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummers"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Mummers}}). In Bermuda, Gombeys are seen more as dancers than musicians, with ritualised costumes, accoutrements and steps, whereas in the West Indies the term applies to a musical tradition, not normally accompanied by dance. Afro-Caribbeans came to Bermuda primarily from former Spanish colonies as free, but indentured, servants in the Seventeenth Century ('til the terms of indenture were raised from seven to ninety-nine years as a discouragement). Most of these arrived as Spanish-speaking Catholics, but acculturated to become English-speaking protestants. Smaller numbers of slaves, many of African birth, were also captured from the Spanish and Portuguese and sold in Bermuda, and smaller numbers deliberately imported. Few of the British West Indian traditions we know today had evolved at that point as most of the British West Indian islands postdate Bermuda's settlement, and most of the culture of the Afro-Hispanic and African immigrants of that century, like that of the Native American and Irish sent to Bermuda under similar conditions, has been lost. Over time, the blacks, Native Americans, Irish and some of the English merged together to form a single demographic, originally referred to as "coloured" (leaving Bermuda divided into two subgroups, with those presumed to be of entirely European heritage defined as "white"). In addition to the bass, or \'93Mother\'94 drum, typically home-made the modern Bermudian Gombey is distinguished by the use of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 snare drum}} (generally in pairs), derived from the British use of the instrument. In addition, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle_drum"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 kettle drum}}, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 fife}} are integral parts of Gombey accompaniment d whistles are used by leaders to issue commands. The snare drummers play complicated riffs over the steady pulse of the mother drum, often employing call and response patterns, and striking the rim of the snare, as well as the skin. The result is an exhilarating, intoxicating, rhythmic mix which provides the impulse (or impetus) for both the dancers as well as the followers, with the snare drum patterns driving the body of the movement and the rimshots communicating with the dancer\'92s feet.\
Gombey\'92s costumes cover their bodies from head to toe and are decorated with tassels, mirrors, bells, and other small items and symbols. The peacock feather headdresses, the painted masks, and the capes are distinguishing features of Gombey costumes. Many adornments of the costumes as worn today rely on modern materials or items, such as the Asian peacock feathers, that would have been hard or impossible to come by before the Twentieth Century, but there is little record of the original costume worn, so how it has changed since the Nineteenth Century can only be guessed at. There is a similarity to Native American {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_dance"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Fancy dance}} costumes, which typically incorporate the feathers of native birds, so feathers less extravagant than those of the peacock may once have been a part. The Captains can be identified by their long capes and often carry a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 whip}} to control the troupe or an unruly crowd; The Bowman or Lead Indian carries a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 bow and arrow}} often going slightly ahead of the troupe to scout the way on long marches; and the Warriors carry a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(axe)"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 tomahawk (axe)}} which they place on their shoulder and use during 
\i cockfights
\i0  when they face off against each other to display their expression of the dance. 
\i Freedom dance, junkanoo, cockfights, biblical stories, slow dance, fast dance, snake dance
\i0 , and 
\i rushing back
\i0  are all elements to watch for when observing a Gombey performance.\
Although the Gombeys have enjoyed a remarkable shift in social status, going from a marginalised group to now appearing on postage stamps and performing overseas, there are still today old laws in place that prevent Gombeys from performing in the streets of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Bermuda"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 Hamilton}} without permits.\
