In {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 dance}}, the 
\b galop
\b0 , named after the fastest running gait of a horse (see \cf4 gallop\cf2 ), a shortened version of the original term 
\b galoppade
\b0 , is a lively country dance, introduced in the late 1820s to Parisian society by the \cf4 Duchesse de Berry\cf2  and popular in Vienna, Berlin and London. In the same closed position familiar in the \cf4 waltz\cf2 , the step combined a 
\i \cf4 glissade
\i0 \cf2  with a 
\i \cf4 chass\'e9
\i0 \cf2  on alternate feet, ordinarily in a fast 2/4 time. The 
\i galop
\i0  was a forerunner of the \cf4 polka\cf2 , which was introduced in Prague ballrooms in the 1830s and made fashionable in Paris when Raab, a dancing teacher of Prague, danced the polka at the Od\'e9on Theatre, 1840. In Australian \cf4 bush dance\cf2 , the dance is often called 
\b galopede
\b0 . An even more lively, faster version of the galop called the \cf4 can-can\cf2  developed in Paris around 1830.\
The galop was particularly popular as the final dance of the evening. The \cf4 Post Horn Galop\cf2 , written by the \cf4 cornet\cf2  virtuoso Herman Koenig, was first performed in London, 1844; it remains a signal that the dancing at a hunt ball or wedding reception is ended.\
Numerous 
\i galops
\i0  were written by the "Waltz King" \cf4 Johann Strauss II\cf2 . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Shostakovich"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Dmitri Shostakovich}} employed a "posthorn galop" as the second, Allegro {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scherzo"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 scherzo}} of his {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._8_(Shostakovich)"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Eighth Symphony}}, 1943. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Franz Schubert}} also composed the fourth movement of his {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._2_(Schubert)"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Symphony No. 2}} on the galop. Particularly famous is the "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Galop"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Devil's Galop}}" by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Williams_(composer)"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Charles Williams}}. The "Infernal Galop" from 
\i \cf4 Orpheus in the Underworld
\i0 \cf2  by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Jacques Offenbach}} and the "Comedians' Galop" from 
\i \cf4 The Comedians
\i0 \cf2  by \cf4 Dmitry Kabalevsky\cf2  are two other well-known galops.\
Danish composer {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Lumbye"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Hans Christian Lumbye}} (1810\'961874) wrote several galops, of which the "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_Galop"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Champagne Galop}}" (1845) is particularly famous. Other notable works include the "Copenhagen Steam Railway Galop" (1847) and the "Telegraph Galop" (1844). {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gershwin"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 George Gershwin}} composed the galop {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Ballet_Class_(Gershwin)"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf4 French Ballet Class}} for two pianos for his score to the film {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shall_We_Dance_(1937_film)"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf4 Shall We Dance}}. Some galops were also written by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nino_Rota"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Nino Rota}}. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Waldteufel"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \'c9mile Waldteufel}} also wrote several galops, of which 
\i Prestissimo
\i0  (1877) is particularly famous.\
