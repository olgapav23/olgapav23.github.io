\b0  is a genre of Brazilian music that originated in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_Brazil"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Northeastern Brazil}}. It encompasses various {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 dance}} styles as well as a number of different musical beats. This music genre has gained widespread popularity in all regions of Brazil. Forr\'f3 is closely associated with Brazilian {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festa_Junina"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 June Festivals}}, which celebrate a number of Christian {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 saints}}.

\f1\b\fs36 \cf5 \strokec5 Origin of the term
\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa140\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \strokec2 There are several theories on the origin of the name.\
The main theory is that 
\i forr\'f3
\i0  as a derivative of 
\i forrobod\'f3
\i0 , meaning "great party" or "commotion". This is the view held by Brazilian folklorist {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_da_C%C3%A2mara_Cascudo"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Lu\'eds da C\'e2mara Cascudo}}, who studied the Brazilian Northeast through most of his life. Forrobod\'f3 is believed to come from the word 
\i forbod\'f3
\i0  (itself a corruption of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauxbourdon"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 fauxbourdon}}), which was used in the Portuguese court to define a dull party. The word 
\i forrobod\'f3
\i0  is itself very common in Portuguese popular conversation to describe a fun, but almost depraved and limitless party. This word was carried by Portuguese migration waves to Brazil, and lost the light negative meaning and was slowly simplified by their children.\
Yet another theory often heard popularly in Brazil and elsewhere\'97for example, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilberto_Gil"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Gilberto Gil}} provides it in concerts\'97is that the word 
\i forr\'f3
\i0  is a derivative of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 English}} expression "for all" and that it originated in the early 1900s. English engineers on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_of_Brazil"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Great Western Railway of Brazil}} near {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Recife}} would throw balls on weekends and classify them as either only for railroad personnel or for the general populace ("for all"). This belief was somewhat reinforced by a similar practice by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAF"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 USAF}} personnel stationed at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal_Air_Force_Base"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Natal Air Force Base}} during {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 World War II}}, but it is unrelated because before the USAF went to Natal, the name "Forr\'f3" was already in use.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf5 \strokec5 Popularity\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa140\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs28 \cf2 \strokec2 Forr\'f3 is the most popular genre of music and dance in Brazil's Northeast, to the extent that historically "going to the Forr\'f3" meant simply going to party or going out. Regarding the music, it is based on a combination of three instruments ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 accordion}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabumba"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 zabumba}} and a metal triangle). The dance however becomes very different as you cross the borders of the Northeast into the Southeast. As part of the popular culture it is in constant change. The dance known as 
\i college forr\'f3
\i0  is the most common style between the middle-class students of colleges and universities in the Southeast, having influences of other dances like salsa and samba-rock.\
The traditional music used to dance the forr\'f3 was brought to the Southeast from the Northeast by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Gonzaga"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Luiz Gonzaga}}, who transformed the bai\'e3o (a word originated from 
\i baiano
\i0  and assigned a warm-up for artists to search for inspiration before playing) into a more sophisticated rhythm. In later years, forr\'f3 achieved popularity throughout Brazil, in the form of a slower genre known as 
\i xote
\i0 , that has been influenced by pop-rock music to become more acceptable by Brazilian youth of Southeast, South and Central regions.\

\b\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf5 \strokec5 Dancing styles\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs28 \cf2 \strokec2 There are three rhythms of forr\'f3: xote (a slower-paced rhythm), bai\'e3o (the original forr\'f3) and arrasta-p\'e9 (the fastest of the three), and amongst these, many styles of dancing, which varies from region to region, and may be known by different names according to the location. Forr\'f3 is danced in pairs, usually very close together, with the man's left hand holding the woman's right hand as in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Waltz}}, his right arm around her back and her left arm around his neck; Other styles may require to stay partially away, or in a considerable distance, only holding their hands up the shoulders. Influences from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_(dance)"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 salsa}} and other Caribbean dances has given mobility to forr\'f3, with the woman - and occasionally the man - being spun in various ways, although it's not essential to spin at all, and more complex movements may prove impossible to be executed in the usually crowded dancing area of forr\'f3s. Follows below a list of the most popular styles of forr\'f3 in Brazil:

\cf2 \cb3 Miudinho and puladinho can also be danced to bai\'e3o music and even to arrasta-p\'e9, but in the latter the leg work is so intense that it's impracticable. Some people also like to include brega/calypso in the forr\'f3 category, because this dance has suffered much influence of forr\'f3 throughout the decades, but it's danced to its own rhythm (not to be mistaken with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_music"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Calypso music}}).\
