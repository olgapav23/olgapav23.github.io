				<em>Ivan Shsihkin, In the Wild North, 1891</em>
				<br>
				<p>Ivan Shishkin was an exceptional painter and engraver whose work concentrated on depicting the beauty and wonders of Russian nature and its inhabitants. At the age of 12 he went to art school in Moscow and after completion, continued his studies in Saint Petersburg. His curiosity and desire to train more allowed him to be awarded for many of his paintings early in his career. His remarkable ownership of  the brush and pencil allowed his brilliant genius to leave us today to admire his work and get a closer look on astonishing landscapes of Russian nature and its inhabitants.</p>
